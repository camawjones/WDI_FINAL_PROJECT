# GA WDI30 Project 3 - Lookalove (Where The Stars Align)

Lookalove (Where The Stars Align) is a full MERN stack mobile-first site with a mongoDB database that aims to be the No.1 dating app for professional lookalikes to find the love of their looka-lives.

Within the app, users receive other potential dates to swipe through in a ‘tinder’ style, receiving a match when both the current user and the swiped user swipe right on each other. It utilises a matching logic built using the mongoose-friends package and swipe functionality which was enabled through the react-swipe-card react.js package.

For my final project I wanted to create an app that would be remembered and instantly recognised. Using photoshop to edit or design the assets myself I aimed to play to the faux celebrity and Hollywood glam style of Lookalikes themselves which I think I successfully achieved.

Below are my wireframes and userflows that I designed using Sketch. I wanted to make sure I understood exactly how the user would use the app right from the beginning of the project so that there couldn't be any major hickups later down the line.:

##### Packages:
 - mongoose-friends (react)
 - react-swipe-card (react)
 - bcrypt
 - mongoose-fill
 - jsonwebtoken
 - bluebird
 - bootstrap-css-only


Once two lookalikes swipe right on each they both recieve a notification informing them that they have matched ('looks like this lookalike likes the look of you').

Once this has been recieved by the user, the other recipient of the notification is added to their list of matches and both now have the ability to message each other.

After either the current user sends a message or recieves a message, a chat is then added to their account.

The project was 10 days long and was extremely enjoyable for me to work on. 

Some extra features that I wish to add are:

- Implementing google Maps API in order to filter users by current location.
- Make app fully responsive.
- Seed more data.
